<div id="th_165" class="t s4_165">The Suffah (platform/area or the area in the shade of a building) is an area where many of the Sahabah were taught by the Prophet </div>
<div id="ti_165" class="t s4_165">(P.B.U.H.). Many people assume that the raised platform near Bab Jibril is the Suffah. According to researchers, this could not have </div>

<div id="to_165" class="t s4_165">There are eight pillars in the Rawdah which have significance. Each pillar is marked on top individually. They are however not to be </div>
<div id="tp_165" class="t s4_165">kissed, hugged or revered, but rather near them one may offer Salah and make du`a’ to Allah. Most of these are pointed out by scholars </div>

<div id="ts_165" class="t s7_165">It </div>
<div id="tt_165" class="t s4_165">was on this spot that once a palm tree used to grow. Prior to the building of the Mimbar, Rasulullah (P.B.U.H.) used to lean on it </div>
<div id="tu_165" class="t s4_165">while delivering the khutbah. When the mimbar was made, Rasulullah (P.B.U.H.) used that instead during the khutbah. It so happened </div>
<div id="tv_165" class="t s4_165">when the change took place, such a piercing sound of weeping came from the tree, that those in the Masjid also started weeping. </div>
<div id="tw_165" class="t s4_165">Rasulullah went to the tree and by placing his hand on it, its crying stopped. Rasulullah then said: “The tree cries because the Dhikr of </div>
<div id="tx_165" class="t s4_165">Allah I was near it, and now that the Mimbar is built, it has been deprived of this Dhikr in its immediate vicinity. If I did not place my </div>

<div id="t11_165" class="t s4_165">A’ishah ((P.B.U.H.).A.) reports that Rasulullah (P.B.U.H.) said: “In this Masjid is one such spot that if people knew the true blessed </div>
<div id="t12_165" class="t s4_165">nature thereof, they would flock towards it in such a manner, that to pray there they would have to cast lots to get a turn (Arabic for </div>

<div id="t14_165" class="t s4_165">People asked her to point out the exact spot. When she did not answer they sent her nephew `Abdullah ibn </div>
<div id="t15_165" class="t s4_165">Zubayr. They watched him as he performed Salah at the same spot. They also watched his son `Amir also perform Salah at that spot. It </div>
<div id="t16_165" class="t s4_165">was on this that they marked this spot as being the one `A’ishah ((P.B.U.H.).A.) had mentioned. </div>

<div id="t18_165" class="t s5_165">Ustuwanah Tawbah / Abu Lubabah </div>
<div id="t19_165" class="t s4_165">Abu Lubabah t was more furious with the Banu Quray~ah than others, when they went against their pledge with the Muslims, as he had </div>
<div id="t1a_165" class="t s4_165">trusted them the most. When they were defeated and taken captive he told them that they were to be killed by making a sign across his </div>
<div id="t1b_165" class="t s4_165">throat. After having done that, he became so grieved at this premature indiscretion that he could not rest. He thereupon came to the </div>
<div id="t1c_165" class="t s4_165">Masjid and at this spot where a date-tree used to stand, he bound himself to the trunk saying: “As long as my repentance is not accepted </div>
<div id="t1d_165" class="t s4_165">by Allah, I shall not untie myself from here. And Rasulullah himself must undo my bonds.” When Rasulullah heard this he said: “If he </div>
<div id="t1e_165" class="t s4_165">had come to me I could have begged forgiveness on his behalf. Now he had acted on his own initiative, I cannot untie him until his </div>
<div id="t1f_165" class="t s4_165">repentance has been accepted.” For many days he remained tied there. His wife and daughter used to untie him for Salah or for when he </div>
<div id="t1g_165" class="t s4_165">had to answer the call of nature, and thereafter tie him up again. He remained without food and drink for so long as a result of which his </div>
<div id="t1h_165" class="t s4_165">sight and hearing were affected. In this state after many days Rasulullah was in Tahajjud prayer in the house of Umm Sallamah, when </div>
<div id="t1i_165" class="t s4_165">he received the good news that Abu Lubabah’s repentance had been accepted. </div>
